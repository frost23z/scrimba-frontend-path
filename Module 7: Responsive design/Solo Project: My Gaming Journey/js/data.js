            <h1>Dishonored: The Art of Choice</h1>
            <img src="images/dishonored-1.jpg" alt="Dishonored" class="blog-hero-image">
            
            <p>Dishonored stands as one of the finest examples of player agency in modern gaming. This steampunk masterpiece doesn't just give you choices—it makes every decision meaningful and consequential.</p>
            
            <h2>The Outsider's Mark</h2>
            <p>The supernatural abilities granted by the Outsider transform how you interact with the world. Blink doesn't just let you teleport—it fundamentally changes how you think about space and movement.</p>
            
            <h2>Chaos and Consequence</h2>
            <p>The chaos system is brilliant in its simplicity. Kill too many people, and the world becomes darker, more plague-ridden, more hostile. It's not just a morality meter—it's a reflection of how violence begets violence.</p>
            
            <p>Dishonored proves that the best games don't just entertain—they make us think, reflect, and question our own choices both in-game and in life.</p>

            <p>Dishonored 2 takes everything that made the original great and refines it to perfection. The choice between playing as Emily or Corvo offers genuinely different perspectives on power and responsibility.</p>
            
            <h2>Emily's New Powers</h2>
            <p>Emily's abilities feel fresh and innovative. Domino links enemies together, creating elaborate chain reactions. Far Reach gives you a different kind of mobility than Blink.</p>
            
            <h2>Karnaca's Beauty and Danger</h2>
            <p>The setting of Karnaca is a masterclass in environmental design. The sun-soaked Mediterranean architecture contrasts beautifully with the dark underbelly of corruption.</p>
            
            <p>Dishonored 2 proves that sequels can innovate while staying true to what made the original special.</p>

            <img src="images/tomb-raider-2012.jpeg" alt="Tomb Raider 2012" class="blog-hero-image">
            
            <p>The 2012 Tomb Raider reboot wasn't just a new game—it was a complete reimagining of what Lara Croft could be. Gone was the invincible adventurer, replaced by a vulnerable human being thrust into extraordinary circumstances.</p>
            
            <h2>Survival Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The survival elements aren't just gameplay mechanics—they're storytelling tools. Hunting for food, making fire, and crafting equipment all serve to show Lara's evolution from student to survivor.</p>
            
            <h2>Character Development</h2>
            <p>Watching Lara's first kill and seeing her reaction makes every subsequent action feel earned. This isn't a power fantasy; it's a journey of transformation that feels genuine.</p>
            
            <p>This reboot succeeded because it understood that great action-adventure games are built on strong characters and emotional stakes.</p>

            <p>Rise of the Tomb Raider builds upon the strong foundation of the 2012 reboot with more confident storytelling and stunning environments that make Siberia feel both beautiful and deadly.</p>
            
            <h2>Improved Tomb Design</h2>
            <p>The tombs in Rise are significantly more elaborate and satisfying than the first game. Each feels like a proper puzzle chamber with environmental storytelling.</p>
            
            <h2>Lara's Growth</h2>
            <p>This Lara feels more confident and capable while still maintaining the vulnerability that made the first game's character development so compelling.</p>
            
            <p>Rise of the Tomb Raider is a perfect middle chapter that builds anticipation for Lara's full transformation while telling a complete story.</p>

            <h2>Three Protagonists</h2>
            <p>The three-character structure works brilliantly, giving us different perspectives on the same criminal underworld. Michael's midlife crisis, Franklin's ambition, and Trevor's chaos each offer unique gameplay styles.</p>
            
            <h2>Los Santos as a Character</h2>
            <p>The city itself is the real star. From the hills of Vinewood to the beaches of Vespucci, every area feels distinct and purposeful.</p>
            
            <p>GTA V proves that open-world games can be both massive in scope and detailed in execution, creating experiences that feel truly limitless.</p>
