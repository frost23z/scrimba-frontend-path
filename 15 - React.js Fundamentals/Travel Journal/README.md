# Travel Journal

A React-based travel journal application that displays travel experiences and destinations in a clean, card-based layout.

## Features

- **Travel Entry Cards**: Display travel destinations with photos and descriptions
- **Location Information**: Country and Google Maps integration for each destination
- **Date Ranges**: Show travel dates for each trip
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable React components for travel entries
- **Static Data Rendering**: Displays predefined travel data from a data file

## How It Works

1. Travel data is stored in a separate data.js file
2. The main App component maps over the travel data array
3. Each travel entry is rendered as a reusable Card component
4. Props are passed down to display location, dates, and descriptions
5. Images and location pins provide visual context for each destination
